## Preview

This is an app that displays the cryptocurrency market trends and is meant to allow you to connect your crypto storage and buy coins.

## Technology used:

- I used react (useParams, useState, Router, Link)



## Approach:
The main approach I used was to seperate everything into different components. One of the adb=vantages of react is the modularity, and i wanted to take full advantage of it. 

## Main features:
- search
- nav bar
- connect wallet
- footer
- display of the 250 most popular coins

## User Stories
-As a user, I want to be able to easily distinguish upward and downward trends
- As a user, I should be given the list in order of relevance
- As a user, I should be able to use the navigation bar to move around
- as a user i should be able to get information on each con, and see market trends in real time.
- As a user, I should be able to connect my cold storage (wallet).



## What left?
- sort and filters by vharacteristics
- chart trend display
